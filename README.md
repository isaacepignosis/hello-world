Hi Team GitHub
My name is Isaac and I'm a Finance Project Manager.
I use Github to see if it can be a good tools to boost the ways we work in finance with excel.

Hello TEAM, I just saw this news on wikipedia.
GitHub is an American company that provides hosting for software development.
Github includes version control using Git, which allows software projects to keep track of all versions and revert to previous versions if necessary.
It is a subsidiary of Microsoft, which acquired the company in 2018 for $7.5 billion.
